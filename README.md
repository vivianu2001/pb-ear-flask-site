# 🧠 Participatory Budgeting with PB-EAR

Welcome! This repository presents a full-stack implementation and web demonstration of the **PB-EAR algorithm** – an algorithmic solution for fair public budget allocation based on community preferences.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Vivian Umansky**, a computer science student at **Ariel University**.  
This project was developed as part of my final assignment for the **Research Algorithms** course.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores **Participatory Budgeting** (PB) – a democratic process where citizens vote on how to distribute a limited public budget across multiple projects.

I implemented the **PB-EAR** rule (**Proportional Budgeting via Expanding Approval Rule**) —  
a cutting-edge algorithm proposed in the paper:

> _Proportionally Representative Participatory Budgeting with Ordinal Preferences_  
> by Haris Aziz and Barton E. Lee

PB-EAR ensures proportionality and fairness in collective budget decisions when voters submit **ranked preferences** over projects.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- 💻 **Python** for backend algorithmic logic
- 🌐 **Flask** for the web framework
- 🎨 **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the interactive frontend
- 🗳️ Integrated with a fork of [**pabutools**](https://github.com/COMSOC-Community/pabutools) – an open-source PB toolkit

## 🚀 What You Can Do on the Site

- 🏗️ Define a custom list of public projects and costs
- 👥 Add multiple voter groups with ranked preferences and weights
- 💸 Enter a total budget constraint
- 📈 Run PB-EAR to allocate funding fairly
- 🔍 Visualize the outcome and analyze representation
